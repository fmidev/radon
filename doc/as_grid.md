## Database Table: `as_grid`

### Table Description
The `as_grid` table in the `public` schema is designed to manage grid-based data associated with various forecasts. It includes information about the producer, analysis times, and geometries, along with details about the data schema and table storage.

### Columns

| `schema_name`      | `character varying(50)`         | not null |                                           | Name of the database schema where the grid is stored.  |
| `table_name`       | `character varying(50)`         | not null |                                           | Name of the database table where the grid is stored.   |
| `partition_name`   | `character varying(70)`         |          |                                           | Name of the database partition for the grid data.      |
| `record_count`     | `integer`                       | not null | `0`                                       | The count of records in the grid.                      |
| `delete_time`      | `timestamp with time zone`      | not null |                                           | Timestamp indicating when the grid data will be deleted. |
| `last_updater`     | `text`                          |          |                                           | Information about who last updated the record.         |
| `last_updated`     | `timestamp with time zone`      |          |                                           | Timestamp of the last update to the record.            |
| `min_analysis_time`| `timestamp with time zone`      |          |                                           | Earliest analysis time for the grid data.              |
| `max_analysis_time`| `timestamp with time zone`      |          |                                           | Latest analysis time for the grid data.                |

### Indexes
- **Primary Key**: `id` (using btree)
- **Unique Constraint**: `as_grid_producer_id_analysis_time_geometry_id_uniq_idx` on columns (`producer_id`, `analysis_time`, `geometry_id`) (using btree)

### Foreign-key Constraints
- **`as_grid_fmi_producer_fkey_02`**: Foreign Key constraint on `producer_id` referencing `fmi_producer(id)`

### Notes
- The table serves as a crucial component in handling grid-based data for various analytical purposes, particularly in meteorological or geographical analyses.
- The combination of `producer_id`, `analysis_time`, and `geometry_id` is ensured to be unique, facilitating precise data management.
- The table also tracks the lifecycle of the grid data, including its creation, update, and planned deletion times.
