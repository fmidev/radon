## Database Table: `producer_class`

### Table Description
The `producer_class` table in the `public` schema is designed to categorize producers into different classes. There are only two classes: GRID and POINT.

Table includes unique identifiers for each class, along with names and descriptions.

### Columns
| Column Name   | Type                            | Nullable | Default Value                                | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `integer`                       | not null | `nextval('producer_class_id_seq'::regclass)` | Unique identifier for each producer class.     |
| `name`        | `character varying(50)`         | not null |                                              | Name of the producer class.                    |
| `description` | `text`                          | not null |                                              | Description of the producer class.             |
| `last_updater`| `text`                          |          |                                              | Information about who last updated the record. |
| `last_updated`| `timestamp with time zone`      |          |                                              | Timestamp of the last update to the record.    |

### Indexes
- **Primary Key**: `id` (using btree)
- **Unique Constraint**: `producer_class_name_uniq` on the column (`name`) (using btree)

### Notes
- The `id` column is auto-incremented using a sequence.
- The `name` column has a unique constraint, ensuring that each producer class name is distinct.
- The table provides detailed information about each producer class, including its name and description, and tracks the last updates made.
