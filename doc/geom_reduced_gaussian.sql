| `last_updater`        | `text`                      |          |         | Information about who last updated the record.                 |
| `last_updated`        | `timestamp with time zone`  |          |         | Timestamp of the last update to the record.                    |
| `earth_shape_id`      | `integer`                   |          |         | Reference to an earth shape model.                             |

### Indexes
- **Primary Key**: `id` (using btree)
- **Unique Constraint**: `geom_reduced_gaussian_name_uniq` on the column (`name`) (using btree)

### Check Constraints
- **`geom_reduced_gaussian_datum_chk`**: CHECK (datum_id IS NULL OR datum_id IS NOT NULL AND earth_shape_id IS NULL)
- **`geom_reduced_gaussian_scanning_mode_chk`**: CHECK (scanning_mode = ANY (ARRAY['+x-y'::text, '+x+y'::text]))

### Foreign-key Constraints
- **`geom_reduced_gaussian_datum_id_fkey`**: Foreign Key constraint on `datum_id` referencing `datum(id)`
- **`geom_reduced_gaussian_earth_shape_id_fkey`**: Foreign Key constraint on `earth_shape_id` referencing `earth_shape(id)`
- **`geom_reduced_gaussian_geom_fkey`**: Foreign Key constraint on `id` referencing `geom(id)`
- **`geom_reduced_gaussian_geom_fkey_02`**: Foreign Key constraint on `name` referencing `geom(name)`

### Notes
- This table is crucial for managing data related to Reduced Gaussian grids, often used in atmospheric and climate models.
- The unique constraints and indexes ensure that each grid is distinct and identifiable by its name.
- The check constraints enforce data integrity, particularly in terms of grid configurations and spatial references.
- The table's relationship with earth shape and datum models adds crucial context for spatial data interpretation.
